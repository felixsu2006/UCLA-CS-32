1. KNOWN BUGS:
	none
2. BIG-O
	-findGenomesWithThisDNA() has big-O (H * G * F) where G is the number of genomes in the library
	everything else seems to satisfy the big-O requirements
3. find()
	for the number of children that root has
		check if any of them hold the value that is equal to the first letter in the given key
			if so, pass the address to the helper function findHelp and return that value

   findHelp()
	for the number of children in the given node
		if exactMatchOnly is false
			if the size of the given string is 1
				store in a vector<Valuetype> the values of the root's current child
				continue
			if the label of the current child node is equal to the first character in the given string
				store in a vector<ValueType> the results of a call to findHelp with a substring (omitting the first character of the string) of the string, keeping exactMatchOnly false
				continue
			do as said above except change exactMatchOnly to true
			continue
		if the label of the current child node is equal to the first character of the given string
			if the size of the given string is 1
				store the given child's values
				break
			store in a vector<ValueType> the results of a call to findHelp with a substring (omitting the first character of the string) of the string, keeping exactMatchOnly true
	return all the stored values

   findGenomesWithThisDNA()
	(1) store in a vector the DNAMatch(es) of the given prefix
	initialize a vector of bools (all with value true) with the same size as (1)
	for the number of (1)
		for the number of genomes in the library
			if the current DNAMatch in the vector of DNAMatch(es) has the same name as the current genome's name
				if the DNAMatch would access out of bounds values
					set the corresponding value in the vector of bools to false
					break
				extract the substring of genome as noted by the DNAMatch's position and size
				for the size of the given string fragment
					if exactMatchOnly is true and the current characters of the given string and the extracted string are not equal
						break
					if they are not equal and exactMatchOnly is false and this is the first occurrence of an inequality
						if the current number is greater than or equal to min_length, increment the DNAMatch's length
					if they are not equal and exactMatchOnly is false and this sis the second occurence of an inequality
						break
					if the number is greater than or equal to min_length
						increment the DNAMatch's length
			if none of the DNAMatch(es) match with a genome from the library, end the loop
	sort the data by genome name
	disregard all nonmaximum lengths of each genome, leaving at most one sequence per genome
	return all the remaining DNAMatch(es)
